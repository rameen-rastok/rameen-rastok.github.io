This is a basic static website. I am following a Youtube Tutorial made by BroCode on HTML and CSS and wanted somewhere to host the website for fun.
I am just an average guy learning Computer Science so this website may change as I learn more.
Please note that the forms submission on the website does not work and will cause a 404 error so don't use it, the reason is that I have not made a PHP file and do not want to learn PHP yet.
I also think that GitHub pages doesn't support PHP since its backend maybe.
I don't own the rights to the lyrics webpage that is owned by Rick Astley :)
Have a good day.
