This is a revamped version of a website I made in my free time by following online courses such as from "Brocode" and "FreeCodeCamp" on YouTube.
The previous version of this website was a messy testing ground for HTML and CSS as I wanted to broaden my programming skills for fun as well as potentially for my future.
This new version of the website is much cleaner and polished than my previous attempt, and makes use of all of the skills I have learnt.
